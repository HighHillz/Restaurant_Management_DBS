## Inspiration
This initially started as my class 12 Computer Science project, where I and two of my other friends had a build something related to SQL and Python. It turned out well with good graphics, handling processed neatly and more. However, based on my visits to restaurants, I had found certain things which I thought adding it to this application might help a lot.

After submitting the project at school (v1.0.0), I soon started adding more features to this application that boosts its accuracy, performance and gives more value to users.
